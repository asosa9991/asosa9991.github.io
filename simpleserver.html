<p>Recently I had a need to create a HTTPS server to support a webhook POC implementation but I ended up searching a 
ot to finally put together a solution. I am hoping that this story would solve that. Lets jump in. 
This server will be using NodeJs runtime and we will be using express, https and fs middleware/modules. 
Before we do anything else, we first need to create the main component of the HTTPS server — the SSL certificate. 
Most of the time when setting up a HTTPS server, the devops would use the standard key/cert issued by a valid CA 
and follow the internal security sop to install. 
But if we are doing a POC or trying to setup one locally, those certs are generally not available.

So the first setup would be to create a SSL cert. I don’t want to lay out all the details on how to 
create a cert here as there is already on very well documented by HEROKU team using openssl that 
I was able to use and create a ssl cert. https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/ssl-certificate-self
</p>

<code>

openssl genrsa -des3 -passout pass:x -out server.pass.key 2048
openssl rsa -passin pass:x -in server.pass.key -out server.key
rm server.pass.key
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

</code>
<p>
Once we have created the SSL cert and have the key & the crt files, we will now create a simple Node app using the 
express middleware and the https & fs modules as below —

</p>

<code>
var express = require(‘express’),
 app = express(),
 https = require(‘https’),
 fs = require(‘fs’),
 options = {
 cert: fs.readFileSync(‘./server.crt’),
 key: fs.readFileSync(‘./server.key’)
 };
app.post(‘/webhook’, function (req, res) {
 console.log(req.body);
 res.send(‘ok’);
});
</code>
